== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= What is GeoRiot =

GeoRiot is a link management platform that maximizes your potential Amazon Associates revenue by globalizing and affiliating your Amazon Links. GeoRiot hopes to change the way online commerce is conducted by providing its customers with intelligent links that automatically route customers to the correct product within their own local storefront.


=Do I need a GeoRiot Account to use this plugin?=

No, you do NOT need a GeoRiot account to use the Amazon Link Engine plugin. As soon as you download the free plugin, all of your links will be automatically localized, and your customers will be routed to the product in their local storefront. However, if you want to add your affiliate parameters, you will need a GeoRiot account.

=Do I have to pay for GeoRiot?=

No, you never need to give us a credit card, or make payments to use the GeoRiot Service. The service is always free.

Please note: It’s important to know that the GeoRiot service costs nothing out of pocket. Instead GeoRiot uses a “Click Share” model where a percentage of your international clicks are redirected using our own affiliate tracking parameters. This unique model helps ensure you maximize your commissions, and is completely transparent via the reporting found in the GeoRiot dashboard. The maximum Click Share rate is 15%. Additional details can be found on our Pay With Clicks page. Please contact GeoRiot if you have any questions.
